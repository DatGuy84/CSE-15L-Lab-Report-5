## Lab Report 5 - Putting It All Together

# Part 1

# Student's post

Hello.  I tried creating a method that would return the median of an array.  In order to check if my 
methods were correct, I created another java file that would test each method and a bash script
that would compile the java files and run the tester file.  While the median method seem to have worked,
it seems that the inOrder method failed which makes me believe that the median method is also wrong.  I
would appreciate help on this problem.
